# Unit 1 

## Present continuous (I am doing) 现在进行时

**Am/is/are + -ing** 

1. At the time of speaking, The action is not finished. 
- I **am** driving. 
- he/she/it **is** working. 
- we/you/they **are** doing etc.

2. **I am doing** something = I'm in the middle of doing it; I've started doing it and I haven't finished. 

3. You can use the present continuous with **today / this week / this year** etc. (periods around now). 

4. We use the present continuous when we talk about changes happening around now, especially with these verbs: 
- **get, change, become, increase, rise, fall, grow, improve, begin, start**

## 

A: I saw Brian a few days ago. 
B: Oh, did you? <u>What's he doing</u> these days? 
A: He's at university. 
B: <u>What is he studying</u>? 
A: Psychology. (心理学)
B: <u>Is he enjoying</u> it? (不用Does)
A: Yes, he says it's a very good course. 

- is + v-ing构成现在进行时, be + v-ed构成被动语态. does用来构成一般现在时和一般过去时的疑问句/否定式, 后根动词原形(实意动词).

助动词用来构成时态和语态. 


# Unit 2 

## Present simple (I do) 一般现在时

- I/we/you/they **drive/work/do** etc. 
- he/she/it **drives/works/does** etc. 

### 1. 

He is not driving a bus. (He is asleep)
but He **drives** a bus. (He is a bus driver.)

### 2. We use the present simple to talk about things in general. We use it to say that something happens all the time or repeatedly, or that something is true in general: 
- Nurses **look** after patients in hospitals. 
- I usually **go** away at weekends. 
- The earth **goes** round the sun. 
- The cafe **opens** at 7.30 in the morning. 

### 3. We use **do/does** to make questions and negative sentences. 

questions: 
- **do** I/we/you/they **work?/drive?/do?**
- **does** he/she/it **work?/drive?/do?**

negative: 
- I/we/you/they **don't** **work/drive/do**
- he/she/it **doesn't** **work/drive/do**

### 4. We use the present simple to say how often we do things. 
- I **get** up at 8 o'clock **every morning**. 
- **How often** do you **go** to the dentist? 
- Julie **doesn't drink** tea **very often**. 
- Robert usually **goes** away **two or three times a year**. 

### 5. **I promise / I apologise** etc. 
- **I promise** I won't be late. (not I'm promising)
- 'What do you **suggest** I do?' '**I suggest** that you ...'

In the same way we say: **I apologise ... / I advise ... / I insist ... / I agree ... / I refuse ...** etc. 

2.1 
My parents <u> live </u> in a very small flat. 
The Olympic Games </u> take </u> place every four years. 

2.2 
What time <u> do the banks close </u> here? (疑问句取决于do后面的次, the banks是they所以用do, 而不是根据time)
It <u> takes </u> me an hour to get to work. How long <u> does it take </u> you? (同样, 疑问句中does根据it来判断. ) 

2.3
Liars are people who <u> don't tell </u> the truth. (people单复数同形, 所以用do)

2.4 
Where <u> do your grandparents </u> live ? (这里的grandparents是复数所以用do)

# Unit 3

4 Can you hear those people? What <u> are they talking </u> about? (Present Continuous 没有do / does, 都是am / is / are + v-ing.)
