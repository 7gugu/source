1. At the time of speaking, The action is not finished. 
- I **am** driving.

# Unit 4

## Compare Present continuous and present simple 2

1. We use continuous forms for actions and happenings that have started but not finished. Some verbs are not normally used in this way. The following verbs are not normally used in the present continuous: 

**like, want, need, prefer**
**know, realise, suppose, mean, understand, believe, remember**
**belong, fit, contain, consist, seem** 

2. **Think** 

When think means 'believe' or 'have an opinion', we do not use the continuous. 
- I **think** Mary is Canadian, but I'm not sure. (not I'm thinking)
- What **do** you **think** of my plan? (=What is your opinion?)

When think means 'consider', the continuous is possible. 
- I **am thinking** about what happened. I often **think** about it. 
- Nicky **is thinking** of giving up her job. (=she is considering it.)

3. **See, hear, smell, taste**
We normally use the present simple (not continuous) with these verbs: 
- **Do** you **see** that man over there? (not Are you seeing) 
- The room **smells**. Let's open a window. 

We often use **can + see/hear/smell/taste**: 
- **I can hear** a strange noise. **Can** you **hear** it? 

4. **Look, feel** 
You can use the present simple or continuous to say how somebody looks or feels now: 
- You **look** well today. or You **are looking** well today. 
- How **do** you **feel** now? or How **are** you **feeling** now? 

but: 
- I usually feel tired in the morning. (not I'm usually feeling)

5. **He is selfish** and **He is being selfish**
He **is being** = He's behaving / He's acting. Compare: 
- I can't understand why he **is being** so selfish. He isn't usually like that. 
(**being** selfish = behaving selfishly at the moment. )
- He never thinks about other people. He is very selfish. (not He is being) 
(=He is selfish generally, not only at the moment. )

We use **am/is/are being** to say how somebody is behaving. It is not usually possible in other sentences: 
- It **is** hot today. (not It is being hot) 
- Sarah **is** very tired. (not is being tired)

4.1 

Nobody **believes** him. (nobody不定代词, 当作it)

4.2 
3 Who does this umbrella belong to? 
5 Is anybody sitting there? 

4.4 
2 Sarah **is being** very nice to me at the moment. (忘记看at the moment) 
5 Why isn't Steve at work today? **Is he** ill? (We use **am/is/are being** to say how somebody is behaving, not in this sentence. )

# Unit 5

## Past simple (I did) 一般过去时 

1. 

2. Very often the past simple ends in **-ed** (regular verbs). 
But many verb are irregular. 
write -> **wrote**
see -> **saw** 
go -> **went** 
shut -> **shut** 

3. In questions and negatives we use **did/didn't** + infinitive (**enjoy/see/go** etc.)
I **enjoyed**. 
she **saw**. 
they **went**. 

**did** you **enjoy**? 
**did** she **see**? 
**did** they **go**? 

I **didn't enjoy**. 
she **didn't see**. 
they **didn't go**. 

4. The past of **be** (**am/is/are**) is **was/were**
I/he/she/it **was/wasn't**
we/you/they **were/weren't** 

**was** I/he/she/it? 
**were** we/you/they? 

5.1 
4 It took her about half an hour. (take -> took)
12 She slept well last night. (sleep -> slept)

5.2 
2 'How did you learn to drive?' 'My father taught me.' (teach -> taught)

5 Joe threw the ball to Sue, who caught it. (throw -> threw, catch -> caught)
6 Ann spent a lot of money yesterday. She bought a dress which cost $100. (spend -> spent, buy -> bought, cost -> cost)

5.3

9 It was hard carrying the bags. They <u> were </u> very heavy. (be -> were, 我竟然写成had be, 哇的一声哭出来)

# Unit 6 

## Past continuous (I was doing)

1. **Was/were -ing** is the past continuous. 
- I/he/she/it **was doing** etc. 
- we/you/they **were doing** etc. 

2. I **was doing** something = I was in the middle of doing something at a certain time. The action or situation had already started before this time, but had not finished. 

3. 

4. We often use the past simple and the past continuous together to say that something happened in the middle of something else. 
- Matt **phoned** while we **were having** dinner. 

But we use the past simple to say that one thing happened after another. 
Compare: 
- When Karen arrived, we **were having** dinner. (= we had already started before she arrived)
- When Karen arrived, we **had** dinner. (= Karen arrived, and then we had dinner) 

5. Some verbs(for example, **know** and **want**) are not normally used in the continuous. 

6.3 
2 I **met** Tom and Jane at the airport a few weeks age. They **were going** to Paris and I **was going** to Rome. We **had** a chat while we **were waiting** for our flights. (主要看动作是否完成, 没完成用was/were doing)
3 I **was cycling** home yesterday when a man **stepped** out into the road in front of me. I **was going** quite fast, but luckily I **managed** to stop in time and **didn't hit** him. 

6.4 
3 '**Did you go** out last night?' 'No, I was too tired.' (看时态, last night一般过去时)

# Unit 7 

## Present perfect 1 (I have done) 

1. **Have/has lost** is the present perfect simple. 
- I/we/they/you **have** (= I'**ve** etc.) + done etc. 
- he/she/it **has** (= he'**s** etc.) + done etc. 

The present perfect simple is **have/has** + past participle. 

2. When we say that 'something **has happened**', this is usually new information. 
- Ow! I'**ve cut** my finger. 
- The road is closed. There'**s been** (there **has been**) an accident. 

When we use the present perfect, there is a connection with now. The action in the past has a result now. 
- 'Where's your key?' 'I don't konw. I'**ve lost** it.' (= I don't have it now)

3. Note the difference between **gone (to)** and **been (to)**. 
- James is on holiday. He **has gone to** Italy. (= he is there now or on his way there)
- Jane is back home now. She **has been to** Italy. (= she has now come back)

- **Just** = a short time age. 
  - 'Are you hungry?' 'No, I'**ve just had** lunch.'

  - 'Don't forget to pay your electricity bill.' 'I'**ve already paid** it.' 
  - 'What time is Mark leaving?' 'He'**s already left**.' 
- **Yet** = unitl now. **Yet** shows that the speaker is expecting something to happen. Use **yet** only in questions and negative sentences. 
  - **Has** it **stopped** raining **yet**? 
  - I've written the email, but I **haven't sent** it **yet**. 

5. You can also use the past simple in the examples on this page. So you can say: 
- 'Is Sally here?' 'No, she **went** out.' or 'No, she'**s gone** out.' 
- 'Are you hungry?' 'No, I **just had** lunch.' or 'No, I'**ve just had** lunch.'

7.4 
2 Joe goes out. Five minutes later, the phone rings and the caller says, 'Can I speak to Joe?'
You say: I'm afraid **he's just gone out**.' (不应该用already因为对方没有期望Joe出去, '刚刚'用just)

Ask her. You say: **Have you found a place to live yet**? 

# Unit 8 

## Present perfect 2(I have done) 

1. When we talk about a period of time that continues from the past until now, we use the present perfect(**have been/have travelled** etc.). 

2. In the following examples too, the speakers are talking about a period that continues until now. 
(**recently / in the last few days / so far / since breakfast** etc.)

3. In the same way we use the present perfect with **today / this evening / this year** etc. when these periods are not finished at the time of speaking.

8.1

We use the present perfect continuous for an activity that has recently stopped or just stopped.

2. We use the present perfect continuous in this way especially with **how long, for** ... and **since** ... The activity is still happening or has just stopped. 
- **How long have** you **been learning** English? (= you're still learning English)

You can use the present perfect continuous for actions repeated over a period of time.

It is possible to leave out **for** (but not usually in negative sentences)
We do not use **for + all** ... (all day / all my life etc.)
You can use **in** instead of **for** in negative sentences. (I haven't ... etc.)

2. Compare **when** ... ? (+ past simple) and **how long** ... ? (+ present perfect).

2. You can use the present perfect for new or recent happenings. 
Use the past simple (not the present perfect) for things that are not recent or new.

# Unit 17 

## Have & have got 

1. Have & have got (= for possession, relationships, illnesses etc.)

1. She used to travel a lot = she travelled a lot often in the past, but she doesn't do this any more. 

2. Something used to happen = it happened often in the past, but no longer happens. 
We also use used to ... for things that were true, but are not true any more. 

3. 'I used to do something' is past. There is no present. You cannot say 'I use to do'. 
To talk about the present, use the present simple (I do).

# Unit 19 

## Present tenses (I am doing / I do) for the future 

1. I'm doing something (tomorrow) = I have already decided and arranged to do it. 
'I'm going to (do) ' is also possible in these sentences. 
But the present continuous is more natural when we talk about arrangements. 
Do not use will to talk about what you have arranged to do. 
You can also use the present continuous for an action just before you begin to do it. This happens especially with verbs of movement(go/come/leave etc.). 

2. We use the present simple (I do) when we talk about timetables, programmes etc. (for public transport, cinemas etc.). 
You can use the present simple to talk about people if their plans are fixed like a timetable. 
But the continuous is more usual for personal arrangements. 

19.1 
5 Are you traveling by car (这里不能用I do, 因为不是timetables, programmes等的)

19.4 
11 Helen, I'm going to the supermarket. Are you come with me? (这里考将来时还是不用Can)

# Unit 20 

## (I'm) going to (do) 

1. I am going to do something = I have already decided to do it, I intend to do it. 

2. I am doing & I am going to do 
We use I am doing (present continuous) when we say what we have arranged to do. (for example: arranged to meet somebody, arranged to go somewhere)
I am going to do something = I've decided to do it (but perhaps not arranged to do it). 
Often the difference is very small and either form is possible. 

3. You can also say that 'something is going to happen' in the future. 

4. I was going to do something = I intended to do it, but didn't do it. 
You can say that 'something was going to happen' (but didn't happen) 

20.2

## Will / shall 1

1. We use I'll (= I will) when we've just decided to do something. When we say 'I'll do something', we announce our decision. 
We often use I think I'll ... and I don't think I'll ... 
In spoken English the negative of will is usually won't (= will not) 

2. Do not use will to talk about what you decided before. 

3. We often use will in these situations: 
- Offering to do something
- Agreeing to do something

You can use won't to say that somebody refuses to do something.

After **I hope**, we generally use the present (will is also possible).

4. I shall ... / we shall ... 
Normally we use shall only with I and we. 
I shall or I will 
we shall or we will 
The negative of shall is shall not or shan't

2. We use both **will** and **going to** to predict future happenings and situations. 
When we say something **is going to** happen, we know this <u>from the situation now.</u> What is happening now shows that something **is going to** happen in the future. Do not use **will** in this type of situation.

# Unit 25 

## When I do / When I've done When and if 

1. 'I'll phone you when I get home' is a sentence with two parts. 
- the main part: I'll phone you 
- the when-part: when I get home 

The time in the sentence is future (tomorrow), but we use a present tense (I get) in the when-part of the sentence. We do not use will in the when-part of the sentence. 

The same thing happens after **while / before / after / as soon as / until / till**. 

2. You can also use the present perfect (have done) after when / after / until / as soon as . 
If you use the present perfect, one thing must be complete before the other (so the two things do not happen together).  
Do not use the present perfect if the two things happen together. 
It is often possible to use either the present simple or the present perfect. 

3. After **if**, we normally use the present simple (**if I do / if I see** etc.) for the future. 

4. When & if

We use **if** (not when) for things that will possibly happen.

1. We use **can** to say that something is possible or allowed, or that somebody has the ability to do something. We use **can** + infinitive. 

2. You can say that somebody **is able to** do something, but **can** is more usual. 
But **can** has only two forms: **can** (present) and **could** (past). So sometimes it is necessary to use **(be) able to**. 

3. Could 
Sometimes **could** is the past of **can**. We use **could** especially with. 
**see hear smell taste feel remember understand** 

We also use **could** to say somebody had the general ability or permission to do something. 

4. **Could** and **was able to** 
We use **could** for general ability. But if you want to say that somebody did something in a specific situation, use **was/were able to** or **managed to** (not could).

# Unit 27 

## Could (do) and could have (done) 

1. **could** not only used be a past of **can**. We also use **could** to talk about possible actions now or in the future (especially to make suggestions). 
**Can** is also possible in these sentences. **Could** is less sure than **can**. 

2. We also use **could** (not **can**) for actions that are not realistic. 

3. We also use **could** (not **can**) to say that something(a situation or a happening) is possible now or in the future. The meaning is similar to **might** or **may**.

Something **could have** happened = it was possible but did not happen.

5. We use **couldn't** to say that something would not be possible.

2. **Must** is similar to **have to**.

You can use **must** or **have to** to give your own opinion.(what you think/to recommend)

But **must** is used in written rules and instructions.

You cannot use **must** to talk about the past.

3. **Mustn't** and **don't have to** are completely different.

You **mustn't** do something = it is necessary that you do not do it. (so don't do it)

3. **Needn't have** (done)
They **needn't have reserved** a table = They reserved a table, but this was not necessary.(Because the restaurant is almost empty)

Compare **needn't** (do) and **didn't need to** (do)

Everything was OK. You **needn't have worried**. (you worried, but it was not necessary)

4. **Needn't have** (done) and **didn't need to** (do)
He **needn't have done** something = he did it, but now we know that it was not necessary.
He **didn't need to** do something = it was not necessary to do it. It doesn't matter whether he did it or not.
**He didn't have to** ... is also possible in these examples.

# Unit 33

## Should 1

You **shouldn't** do something = it isn't a good thing to do.

**Should** is not as strong as **must** or **have to**.

2. You can use **should** when something is not right or what you expect.

We also use **should** to say that we expect something to happen.

3. You **should have done** something = you didn't do it, but it would have been the right thing to do.

You **shouldn't have done** something = you did it, but it was the wrong thing to do.

Compare **should** (do) and **should have** (done).

**I'd better do** something = it is advisable to do it. If I don't do it, there will be a problem or a danger.

The negative is **I'd better not** (=I had better not).

Remember that:
The form is '**had** better' (usually 'I'**d** better / you'**d** better' etc. in spoken English).
**Had** is normally past, but the meaning of **had better** is present or future, not past.
We say 'I'd better **do**' (not to do)

2. **Had better** and **should**
**Had better** is similar to **should**, but not exactly the same. We use **had better** only for a specific situation, not for things in general. You can use **should** in all types of situations to give an opinion or give advice.

Also, with **had better**, there is always a danger or a problem if you don't follow the advice.
**Should** means only 'it is a good thing to do'.

3. **It's time** ...
You can say **It's time** (for somebody) **to** ...
When we use **it's time** + past (we **went** / I **did** / they **were** etc.), the meaning is present, not past.
**It's time** somebody **did** something = they should have already done it or started it. We often use this structure to criticise or to complain.
You can also say **It's about time** ... . This makes the criticism stronger.

We use **would have** (**done**) when we imagine situations or actions in the past (= things that didn't happen)

Compare **would** (**do**). (now)
and **would have** (**done**). (past)

We often use **would** in sentences with **if**.

2. Compare **will** (**'ll**) and **would** (**'d**)
Sometimes **would** / **wouldn't** is the past of **will** / **won't**.
Somebody **wouldn't do** something = he/she refused to do it.

3. You can also use **would** to talk about things that happened regularly in the past.
With this meaning, **would** is similar to **used to**.

But you can use **if** ... **would** when you ask somebody to do something.

1. When we imagine a situation like this, we use **if** + past (**if** I **knew** / **if** you **were** / **if** we **didn't** etc.).
But the meaning is present, *not* past.

2. We use the past in the same way after **wish** (I **wish** I **knew** / I **wish** you **were** etc.). We use **wish** to say that we regret something, that something is not as we would like it to be.

3. If I **were** / if I **was**
After **if** and **wish**, you can use **were** instead of **was** (**if I were** / I **wish it were** etc.).
**If I was** / **I wish it was** are also possible.

4. We do not normally use **would** in the **if**-part of the sentence or after **wish**.

Sometimes **wish** ... **would** is possible: **I wish you would listen**.
